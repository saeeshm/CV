# Saeesh Mangwani's CV
This CV was built using the R package [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown).

- saeesh_resume.html - The html version of the resume
- saeesh_resume.pdf - The pdf version
- saeesh_resume.Rmd - The CV in Rmarkdown
- parsing_functions.R - A set of functions to help organize and write google-sheets data into Rmarkdown code chunks
- gather_data.R - A script that reads in my google sheet into R for indexing.
- export_CV.R - A two-line script to generate html and pdf versions of the CV.

I am grateful to [@Nick Strayer](https://github.com/nstrayer) for his [code]([https://github.com/nstrayer/cv](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv)) on using google sheets for organizing CV data, and to [@Beatriz Milz](https://github.com/beatrizmilz) for her excellent CV styling, which helped me ground mine.
